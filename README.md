# Modal-Scale-Finder.py
I want to make music with my keyboard, but I'm not good at the instrument yet. 
This program will help me make music anyway by providing me with all of the modal scales that contain a certain note or notes I enter. 
There are 7 different modes for each of the 12 musical notes, resulting in 84 different modal scales to choose from. 
I simply have to pick 1 to 7 notes on my keyboard that sound good to me, and I will be presented with my options for which scales I can use to write a song.
I will also be able to type "menu" to be presented with all of the scale options, and then type in the name of that scale directly.

Eventually I want to add more features, such as pictures (I know a bit of html and css), more scales (unless that leads to info overload, im which case I'll just make a sequel program), a toggle between traditional scale names and modal names (ex. minor scale vs. aeolian scale), and maybe even the chords for each scale.
